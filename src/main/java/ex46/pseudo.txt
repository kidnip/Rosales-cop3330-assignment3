This program reads text from a file
to assess the frequency of each word
that appears in the text

function getFrequencies(Argument one){

    Initialize a temporary Hash Map
    for every entry in the String array{
        if the Hash Map contains the key already{
            then increment the key value by one
            to simulate the frequency
        }
        else{
            insert an entry of the word into
            the Hash Map, initializing the
            value to one
        }
    }

    Sort the Hash Map into to value descending order,
    so most frequent item is on the top of the list
    Return sorted Hash Map

end
}

{
In the main function

    Create a readable file and initialize an ArrayList for Strings

    try{
        while file has a next line{
            Insert the scanned word from the file into
            the ArrayList
        }
        Convert the ArrayList in a String array and pass
        it to the getFrequencies function as the parameter
        Store the result into a Hash Map

        for every entry in the Hash Map{
            Print the key for the entry
            for the value of each key{
                Print an * to simulate frequency number
            }
        }
    }
    catch{
        Print failure statement
    }
