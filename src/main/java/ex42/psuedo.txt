This program reads a list of names and numbers
from a file and parses the data into separate
parts, before printing to console

function parse(Argument one, Argument two){

    for{
        Split the input where there is a comma
        and insert into an array of String arrays
    }

    return parsed array of arrays

end
}

{
In the main function

    Create readable file and initialize String arrays

    try{
        while{
            Scan each line in the file and insert them
            into the String array and increment a counter
            by one for each line
        }

        Send String array and counter to parse function
        and store result to an array of String arrays

        for{
            for{
                Use nested for loop to print each element
                in the array of arrays in tabular form
                to the user
            }
        }
    }
    catch{
        Print to user if file could not be accessed
    }
}
