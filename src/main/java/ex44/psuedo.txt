This program reads text from a JSON file and
parse it such that the data can be used as to
search a keyword in a database

class Products{
    This is class object that will hold parameters such as
    product name, price, and quantity

    Include getter and setters
}

function parseFile(Argument one, Argument two){

    try{
        Use the JSON library to create an object and array that
        stores the parsed data read from the input file and using
        the GSON library to return the data in a usable class array
    }
    catch{
        Print to user that file could not be accessed
    }

end
}

{
In the main function

    Pass the path and array name of the input JSON file to
    the pareFile function, storing the result in a Products array
    Initialize a flag equal to zero for searching

    Prompt user for a product name
    if the Products array is not null{
        while true{
            for the length of the Products array{
                if a product name matches the user entered name{
                    then save the index of the product name and
                    set a flag equal to one
                    Exit loop
                }
            }
            if flag is one, meaning name was found{
                Print the name, price and quantity of the
                product using the index
                Exit loop
            }
            else{
                Print failure statement to user and prompt
                for another choice
            }
        }
    }
