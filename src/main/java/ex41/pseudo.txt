This program reads a list of names from a file
and sorts them in alphabetical order (descending),
before printing to console

function sort(Argument one, argument two){

    for{
        for{
            Compare names in a String array. Swap
            names based on name after it
        }
    }

    return String array

end
}

{
In main function

    Create readable input file and initialize a String array

    try{
        while{
            Scan file and insert names into String array
            and count number of names with a counter
        }

        Send String[] and counter to the sort function
        for{
            Print each name to the user
        }
    }
    catch{
        Print to user if file could not be read
    }
